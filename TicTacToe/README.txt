Purpose:
	To create a simple TicTacToe game in the terminal.

I wanted to create a simple game that could be played in the terminal and that showed some of the things I have been learning over the past few months. The game is very simple, it is played between two players, each of them states their name and symbol they would like to use. 

The game will keep alternating between the player as long as a valid move is made. The players can input number between 0 and 2. 0 being the first row/column and 2 being the last row/column.
